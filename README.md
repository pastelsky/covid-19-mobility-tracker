# Covid-19 Mobility Tracker

![last synced from source](https://badgen.net/badge/last%20synced%20from%20source/April%2020th%208:01%20PM%20GMT/green) ![last update from google](https://badgen.net/badge/last%20update%20from%20google/April%2011th%205:45%20PM%20GMT/blue)

[Google Mobility Reports](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) show aggregate activity in each country,
and how it changes in response to policies aimed at combating COVID-19. However, it is only published as a PDF
and the data isn't available in a machine-readable format that could enable more richer analysis.

ALL WORK WAS DONE BY PASTELSKY, THIS IS JUST A FORK

**This is an effort to reverse-engineer the PDFs into vectors and ultimately into time-series data available as a JSON Rest API.**

## Usage

#### Country-level data

Country level JSON is available for use at –

```
https://ssugar.github.io/covid-19-mobility-tracker/output/<ISO-COUNTRY-CODE>/mobility.json
```

**For eg India**: https://ssugar.github.io/covid-19-mobility-tracker/output/IN/mobility.json

#### US State-level data

US state level JSON is available at –

```
https://ssugar.github.io/covid-19-mobility-tracker/output/US/<US-STATE-CODE>/mobility.json
```

**For eg: New York**: https://ssugar.github.io/covid-19-mobility-tracker/output/US/NY/mobility.json

### Accessing data as CSV

If you prefer to use CSVs instead, you can go to -

```
https://ssugar.github.io/covid-19-mobility-tracker/output/<ISO-COUNTRY-CODE>/mobility-<social-place>.csv
```

Where social place is one of `parks` | `residential` | `retail-and-recreation` | `transit-stations` | `workplaces` | `grocery-and-pharmacy`

For eg. parks data for India in CSV - https://ssugar.github.io/covid-19-mobility-tracker/output/IN/mobility-parks.csv

For US states, just add the state code after the country code.

#### Data structure

Each data element consists of `date` and `value` (which represents mobility change in percentage)

## Limitations

- Expected error range is ±2%, though errors in activity percentanges
  should be rare given the methodolgy used to extract data.
- As of now, this only indexes country-level data and US state level data. State / Province level breakup for other countries is yet to be added.
- Data sources will be updated once / day and is incumbent upon google publishing updated reports
- It assumes that the same scale (-80% to +80%) is used in all PDFs and they are structured similarly.

## Contributing

1. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.
2. Install Inkscape `1.0beta2` for your OS, and make sure the `inkscape` is available
   as in your path as a command line utility.
   You can test this using `inkscape --version`

3. Run `yarn build` to begin downloading reports form google, and parsing it into the `ouput` folder.
